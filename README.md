# Custom TypeScript library with basic setups

## Compile and Run

Installs dependencies:  
`npm install`

## Development server

To start a local development server you can call:  
`npm run serve`

If you want to test something locally, you can add the changes in index_template.html

When starting the server, webpack will automatically add all the dependencies and create  
and serve a new index.html file. This file is going to be created in dist folder.

To make debug easier source-map-loader is enabled.

## Build

Builds common-utility-web-starter library:  
`npm build`
